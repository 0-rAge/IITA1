  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <h2>a.	What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</h2>
  <p>I remember it distinctly. The pleasure of witnessing the works of my first 3D print. Holding the product of my own making was a surreal experience. Then more than ever is when I fell in love with IT. One of my many interests in learning IT is to better understand the rapid changes in our daily lives. I have always taken a mild interest in IT, and more recently, with significant developments in AI, I feel like it is almost crucial to dig deeper into the world of IT. As mentioned above, the point in time where I began to love IT was when I first started 3D printing. This was around 2020, and I have since had a lot of time to experiment with this hobby skill. I have also taken an interest in building FPV drones, which has given me knowledge in more than one different skill in IT, such as coding, wiring, and soldering.</p>
